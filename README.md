Some Javascript challenges and language practice tests.

For now, all those are from the [freeCodeCamp Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) course and the [HackerRank 10 days of Javascript course](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-javascript).
